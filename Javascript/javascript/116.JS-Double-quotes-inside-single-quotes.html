    <h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

    <p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:</p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      let answer1 = "It's alright";
      let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
      let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 
      answer1 + '<br>' +
      answer2 + '<br>' +
      answer3;
    </script>
